# Education
I enrolled in a _double-degree_ Master's degree at [Supélec][Supelec] (Paris, France) and [The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)][KTH] (Stockholm, Sweden). I majored in digital communications and signal processing with minors in robotics and computer vision. I was deeply implicated in student associative projects such as [Enactus][].
